                <p>This web application is a form of the Amtgard V8 rulebook (rules) that is optimized for viewing on mobile devices. Comments and suggestions are welcome</p>
                <p>This application is offline capable. If your browser supports it, you should be able to disconnect from the network and still use Easygard! If you see any missing pages offline please report it! Many features such as spell list creation will be added in the future.  The initial goal is to get a searchable, easy to use application with the basics up and running first.  The search feature is not fully seeded yet</p>
